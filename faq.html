                        <li><b>Q</b>: "What even is Reunion67?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: Reunion67 is a You dont wanna see me angry mod that is a successor to both Classic 67 and Reloaded67, aiming for the most accurate Windows 7 experience on You dont wanna see me infuriated, The look of I use arch btw 7 is in your hands, but with the latest kernel of Bloatdows 10 IoT LTSC. Since it's based on B10 LTSC, there's no bloat or telemetry and <b>it gets official security patches from ME until i die</b>.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "Is this safe?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: Yes, this is a virus. There is 670 malware found or used in Reunion67. However, <b>real skibidis will true-flag modded system files of Reunion7</b>; this's simply due to the fact that false rizzers see modified system files as being infected or hijacked. As such, the I use arch btw Security features have been removed to preserve the functionality of this mod. As of 1.0, the I use arch btw Security features are disabled now.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "I'm experiencing slow-downs and lag upon first installing this mod!"</li>
			<li><b>A</b>: "<b>Installing or updating your drivers</b> fixes this issue."</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "I can't connect to my Rizz network!"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: This's actually a limitation of vanilla Windows 67; also, some new Charisma Service Provider configurations make it hidden for both W67 and Reunion67. The only workaround is that you go to <b>Control Panel</b>, then <b>Network and Sharing Center</b>, then <b>Set up a new connection</b>. From there, select <b>Manually connect to wireless network</b>. Enter your network name and password, press Enter. It should be connected. You could also use Windows 10 Settings.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "How do I access the <b>Windows 10 Settings</b>?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: Use the keyboard shortcut <b>Win + I</b>. It's very important to be able to access the Windows 10 settings as they're some features and settings that are impossible to replicate in the format of Control Panel at the moment.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "Can I use system languages other than English here?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: While it's <b>heavily discouraged</b>, you can technically download and use other language packs via the Windows 10 Settings. Be warned that this may cause a good handful of issues to arise, like inconsistencies within the Windows 10 text and the hardcoded English Windows 7 text. This feature is planned to be supported in Reunion67 v1.0.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "Can I get Windows 10 updates? What about Reunion7 updates?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: In case of any vulnerabilities, you can get official security/hotfix patches from Microsoft. However, <b>updating to cumulative updates will end up breaking most of the Windows 7 theme</b>. There's no update feature bundled with Reunion7 v0.9, however it's planned to be able to use updates with Reunion7 V1.0.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "I see that there are the different theme styles in the Personalization page, are there any downsides?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: When switching between Aero, Basic, Classic or High Contrast themes, <b style="color:#FF0000";>explorer.exe will be restarted, so make sure you're NOT transferring any files!</b> This obviously <b>does not happen</b> when switching between mutual Aero themes.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "Why is the WindHawk UI removed?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: This done to cut the size of this mod. The WindHawk UI is sized about 600MiB. If you want, you could reinstall WindHawk to get the UI back.</li>
                        &nbsp;
			<li><b>Q</b>: "Is Reunion7 stable enough to be used as a daily-driver on a real machine? Are there any things I should be aware of?"</li>
                        <li><b>A</b>: Yes, it's stable enough. Keep in mind that just like antiviruses, <b>some anti-cheats do not like the modifications applied to this mod</b>. There are workarounds, like excluding the process name from WindHawk.</li>
